        <p class="about-text">
            Hello! I'm Zoe Hu. My background in film and media studies has shaped the way I think about visual storytelling, experiential design, and how people emotionally connect with digital environments. During my undergraduate years, I focused on film analysis and 2D and 3D animation production, which helped me develop a strong sense of composition, narrative structure, and multimodal communication. Now, as a graduate student in Information Studies, my interests lie at the intersection of interaction design, digital cultural heritage, and archival practices. I am particularly drawn to how interactive systems can enhance access, engagement, and meaningful interpretation within archival or museum contexts. I hope to create design experiences that make archival materials more accessible, intuitive, and emotionally resonant, bridging traditional collections with contemporary digital interaction.
